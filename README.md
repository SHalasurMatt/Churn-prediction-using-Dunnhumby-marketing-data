# ADM Final Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the final project for the Advanced Data Modeling (ADM) course. The project involves [brief description of project objective, e.g., analyzing dataset X to predict Y using regression models and exploratory data analysis]. The goal is to provide actionable insights and data-driven recommendations based on the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [source name, e.g., Kaggle, UCI, or company dataset]. Key characteristics of the dataset include:
- Number of rows: [insert]
- Number of columns: [insert]
- Features: [brief description of important features]

## Project Workflow
The analysis follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data type conversions
   - Data normalization and preprocessing

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics
   - Visualization of trends and relationships
   - Identification of outliers and anomalies

3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Regression techniques applied: [list models used, e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso]
   - Model evaluation using [metrics, e.g., RMSE, RÂ², MAE]

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Key findings from the data analysis
   - Recommendations for business or research decisions

## Tools & Libraries
The project was implemented using:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for predictive modeling
- Jupyter Notebook for code execution and documentation

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ADM_Final_Project.git

Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Open ADM_Final_Project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and visualizations.
